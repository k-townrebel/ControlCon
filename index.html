            <h1>What's CtrlCon?</h1>
            <p>CtrlCon is a community organised series of events all over the world promoting GRC Engineering, threat-driven compliance, and modern automation practices. We think it's important to have a CtrlCon movement as the industry is evolving from audit-driven compliance factories to product-focused engineering teams, and practitioners need a space to share implementation patterns, challenge vendor marketing, and build the next generation of GRC infrastructure.</p>
            
            <p>CtrlCon usually goes hand-in-hand with the famous "hallway track", as these events are free and have less of a vendor expo atmosphere than a practitioner meetup. Many people come to talk to peers solving similar problems, share implementation guides, and connect with others building GRC like engineers rather than auditors. Of course, there are always great talks and workshops, and that's the main focus of every CtrlCon event!</p>
            
            <p>The name? CtrlCon has three meanings that capture what we're about:</p>
            <p>1. <strong>Controls:</strong> The fundamental building block of GRC. We design controls, test controls, remediate control gaps, and build compensating controls. Every conversation in GRC eventually comes back to controls.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Ctrl shortcuts:</strong> Every GRC practitioner knows the power of keyboard shortcuts. <span class="shortcut">Ctrl+C</span>, <span class="shortcut">Ctrl+V</span>, <span class="shortcut">Ctrl+F</span> are the tools of our trade. We live in spreadsheets, we automate with code.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>Taking control:</strong> Of how GRC is done. No more audit-driven compliance theatre. No more vendor marketing disguised as thought leadership. We're taking control back.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What is GRC Engineering?</h2>
            <p>GRC Engineering represents an evolution in how organisations approach governance, risk, and compliance. Rather than treating GRC as a compliance factory optimising for auditors, GRC Engineering applies software engineering principles to build threat-driven programs that actually reduce risk.</p>
            
            <p>To see what GRC Engineering means to the community, check out the <a href="#">GRC Engineering Manifesto</a> and read <a href="#">implementation guides</a> from practitioners who've scaled GRC programs at high-growth companies.</p>

            <h2>What's CtrlCon</h2>
            <blockquote>
                "CtrlCon is a community-driven framework for building events for and by GRC practitioners who believe compliance should be threat-driven, not audit-driven. The goal is to bridge the gap between security engineering and traditional compliance, creating opportunities for practitioners to share implementation patterns, challenge the status quo, and build GRC infrastructure that actually reduces risk rather than just satisfying auditors. It is an intense event focused on real implementation details, threat-to-control mapping, automation patterns, and the hard problems that vendor marketing glosses over. It is where the conversations about GRC Engineering are happening." <span class="quote-source">- GRC Engineering Framework</span>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <blockquote>
                "CtrlCon emerged from the GRC Engineering movement that started in 2024 when practitioners realised traditional compliance approaches weren't working. The audit-driven model optimises for external stakeholders whilst creating the 364-Day Problem where controls work perfectly on audit day but drift the rest of the year. CtrlCon brings together security engineers, GRC practitioners, product managers, and forward-thinking auditors who believe we need to treat GRC like a data problem, build evidence collection as infrastructure, and push actionable information back to risk owners rather than just collecting artefacts for compliance theatre. Events are generally free to attend, rely on sponsorship from vendors who actually build useful tools, and are run by practitioners who've lived the pain of scaling GRC programs at high-growth companies."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>It's All About Controls</h2>
            <p>Every GRC program ultimately comes down to controls. At CtrlCon, we focus on the real work:</p>
            <p>- Designing controls that map to actual threats, not just framework requirements</p>
            <p>- Testing controls continuously, not once per year</p>
            <p>- Remediating control gaps before they become incidents</p>
            <p>- Building compensating controls when primary controls fail</p>
            <p>- Automating control evidence collection as infrastructure</p>
            <p>- Measuring control effectiveness with real metrics, not audit opinions</p>
            <p>- Understanding when a control is actually a detective control masquerading as preventive</p>
            <p>- Pushing control monitoring data back to the teams who can act on it</p>

            <h2>CtrlCon History</h2>
            <p>CtrlCon was born out of frustration with traditional compliance conferences that focused more on vendor marketing and audit checklists than on solving real practitioner problems. In 2024, Ayoub launched the GRC Engineering movement through his <a href="#">manifesto</a> and newsletter, advocating for treating GRC like a product organisation rather than a compliance factory.</p>
            
            <p>The movement gained traction as practitioners worldwide resonated with the idea that GRC should be threat-driven, not audit-driven. By late 2024, a community of 2,000+ newsletter subscribers, 25,000+ LinkedIn followers, and 150+ company leaders had formed around these principles.</p>
            
            <p>CtrlCon emerged as the natural next step: a conference framework that would bring this community together for genuine knowledge sharing, implementation pattern discussions, and collaborative problem-solving, without the vendor theatre that dominates traditional compliance events.</p>
            
            <p>The name reflects the daily reality of GRC practitioners: we live in spreadsheets, we automate with code, and we know every keyboard shortcut. But more fundamentally, we live and breathe controls. We design controls, we test controls, we document control evidence, we build compensating controls, we map controls to frameworks, and we obsess over control effectiveness. CtrlCon is about taking back control of how we work with controls.</p>

            <h2>Manifesto</h2>
            <p>CtrlCon is built on the principles of the GRC Engineering movement:</p>
            <p>1. Compliance should be threat-driven, not audit-driven</p>
            <p>2. GRC is fundamentally a data architecture problem</p>
            <p>3. Evidence collection should be automated infrastructure, not manual toil</p>
            <p>4. Controls should be continuously monitored, not checked once per year</p>
            <p>5. The goal is risk reduction, not just satisfying frameworks</p>
            <p>6. Practitioners should challenge broken industry practices</p>
            <p>7. Knowledge sharing beats vendor marketing every time</p>
